            <h1><u>Ageing</u></h1>
            <p>The world's population is ageing. Virtually every country in the world is 
                experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older persons in their population. <br> <br>
            Population ageing is poised to become one of the most significant social
                transformations of the twenty-first century, with implications for nearly all sectors of society,
            including labour and financial markets, the demand for goods and services, such as housing, transportation
            and social protection, as well as family structures and intergenerational
            ties.</p>
            <video src="file/Agefriendly_1080p.mp4" controls width="100%"></video>
            
            <p>Older persons are increasingly seen as contributors to development, whose abilities to act for 
                the betterment of themselves and their societies should be woven into policies and
            programmes at all levels. In the coming decades, many countries are likely to face fiscal
            and political pressures in relation to public systems of health care, pensions and social 
            protections for a growing older population.</p>

        Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis are prevalent among seniors.

        <h2>Understanding Diabetes</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a condition that affects how your body turns food into sugar (glucose). 
        This sugar is your body's main source of energy. With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough 
        insulin, or it can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your 
        cells to be used for energy.</p>

            <h4>Types of diabetes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Type 1 diabetes</li>
                <li> Type 2 diabetes</li>
                <li> Gestational diabetes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Symptoms of diabetes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Frequent urination</li>
                <li>Increased thirst</li>
                <li>Extreme hunger</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Blurred vision</li>
                <li>Slow-healing sores</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>How diabetes progresses:</h4>
            
            <p>Diabetes can damage blood vessels and nerves throughout 
            your body. This can lead to serious complications, including heart
             disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage.</p>
